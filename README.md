# Data Visualization Final Project

## 1. Introduction

This project presents a data analysis and visualization report originally created in a Jupyter Notebook and exported as a static HTML document. It includes textual analysis, tabular outputs, and plots generated using Python libraries. The visualizations help explore and interpret a dataset through descriptive statistics and graphical representation. The objective is to enable users to interpret data trends easily and effectively using dynamic visual components.

## 2. Objectives

- Apply data visualization
- Create multiple types of visualizations (e.g., bar, pie, and line charts)
- Enable interactivity and responsiveness in data presentation
- Enhance understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling
- Explore a dataset using Python’s data analysis libraries
- Visualize trends, distributions, and relationships in data
- Generate insights using clear and informative charts
- Present findings in a portable, web-friendly HTML format
---

## 3. Technologies Used

- **Python (via Jupyter Notebook)**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – for basic plotting
- **Seaborn** – for statistical visualizations
- **Plotly** - for Advance Charts and Plots

---

## 4. Project Structure


*Note: The project is self-contained with all code embedded in the HTML file.*

---

## 5. Features

- Interactive visualizations with dynamic data handling
- Multiple chart types (bar, line, pie)
- Descriptive statistics and data summaries
- Distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, and categorical comparisons
- Self-contained HTML file with embedded outputs and styling
- Intuitive and clean user interface for ease of data interpretation

---

## 6. How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the project folder to your system.
2. Open the `Data Visualization Final Project.html` file using any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. Explore the different sections and interact with the charts to view insights.

*No additional libraries or installation is needed. The file is completely standalone.*
